Description
============

Jquiz, is a small flash-card application for learning Japanese vocabulary.
Jquiz has two modes: practice and quiz.

In practice mode, you can select a group of words from your list and train until master them.
You can choose what you want to learn (hiragana, meaning or kanji).
Practice mode also allows you to know the pronunciation of the word.

In quiz mode, the program gives you a word and you should write it in kanji.
Quiz mode has a handwriting area to write the response by using a pen mouse.
The handwriting implementation is based on Wagomu (http://www.tegaki.org).


How to use
============
Jquiz requires a file in the following format:

<Word in Kanji><TAB><Meaning of the word><TAB><Word in hiragana> (separated by tabs) 
<Word2 in Kanji><TAB><Meaning of the word2><TAB><Word2 in hiragana>
<Word3 in Kanji><TAB><Meaning of the word2><TAB><Word3 in hiragana>

I provide several list for mastering the N2 exam vocabulary.
You can create you own list or use my scrips in ruby to extract vocabulary from Internet.


Installing
===========
Jquiz is implemented in C and uses GTK libraries for the UI.
It has been tested in Linux. 
Since I do not use any Linux library, I guess that It can work in any other platform.

Dependencies:
Install the following libraries (development packages):

gtk+-2.0 >= 2.12.0
gthread-2.0
sqlite3
gstreamer-0.10




Run:

cd src

./configure

make install
